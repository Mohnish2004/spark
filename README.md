**View Development Attempt:**  
While I didn’t have time to fully build the product solo, I focused heavily on design and prototyping to ensure the concept comes through clearly.

## Overview

**Spark** is an AI-powered platform that helps interns and early-career employees at Microsoft build meaningful relationships across the company — starting with a simple coffee chat.

Interns often want to connect with mentors, leaders, or peers but don’t know who’s open, when they’re available, or how to start the conversation. Spark solves this with smart matching based on availability, goals, shared interests, and location — and helps schedule the right conversations at the right time.

## Key Features

- **Smart Matching** — Match with mentors and peers based on shared tags, roles, orgs, and intent.
- **Availability-Aware Scheduling** — Show preferred time blocks and match only when there's overlap.
- **AI-Generated Messages** — Copilot-style prompts help you start the conversation with context.
- **"Why This Match Matters" Summary** — Explain the relevance and shared connection to reduce awkward outreach.
- **Simple Discovery UI** — Swipe to connect, scroll to learn more, schedule without friction.

## Current Status

- Core designs and UX flows completed
- Swipe interface and onboarding screen development started
- AI prompt system and scheduling logic still in progress
- Intended to be functional for basic matching by end of hackathon timeline
